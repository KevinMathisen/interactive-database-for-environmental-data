## Queries
### Map page
For all rivers and station, we want to get the following attributes: `ID`, `Coordinates`, `Species`, `Date`

#### Get all rivers with their underlying species
Use the following request to get all river with their underlying species for filtering:
`GET /rivers_with_species`


#### Get all stations with their underlying species
Use the following request to get all stations with their underlying species for filtering:
`GET /station_with_species`


### Get summary information for a river
For a choosen river, we want to retrieve the following information if it has not already been retrived.
- ID
- Date
- Name
- Project ID
- Water flow
- Boat type
- Crew
- Comments
- For each underlying station:
  - Station number
  - Rivertype
  - Weather
  - Minutes fished
  - Amount of fish catched

First query to get the river and which stations are under it:

`GET /river_summary?id=eq.${id}`

Then get the stations under the river:
`GET /station_summary?id=in.(${station1}, ${station2})`

### Get summary information for a station
For a choosen station, we want to retrieve the following information if it has not already been retrived.
- ID
- Date
- Time of day
- Station number
- Project ID
- Station description
- Conditions
  - Rivertype
  - Weather
  - Water temperature
  - Air temperature
  - Time spent fishing
- Power setting
  - Voltage
  - Pulse (DC)
  - Conductivity
- For each species (and the sum)
  - Amount 
  - Median
  - Average
  - Minimum 
  - Maximum

Query to get the station information and underlying observations
`GET /station_summary?id=eg.${id}`

### List page
Exactly the same queries as the map page, except for selecting different attributes when quering all rivers and stations. The attributes we want here are `ID`, `Name`, `Date`, `Project number`, and `Species`. The stations will in addition require `Station number` and `time of day`. 


### Graph page
If a river is choosen, and the rivers stations are not defined, we need to query for the river stations
`GET /river_summary?select=id,stations&id=eg.${riverid}`

Then for each station, we need to finds its observations. Or, if one station is selected, we simply get the observations for that station.
`GET /station_with_observations?id=in.(${station1},${station2})`

### Download page
If river and station are not already queries from other pages, these will be queried the same way as the map and list page, with the following attributes: `ID`, `Name`, `Date`, and `Species`. The stations will in addition require `Station number`.

  SELECT 
    elvedata.id,
    elvedata.elv AS name,

Stasjonsdata.nummer and .dato is not yet included in the SQL schema.

### Download information for River
There is no need for a sql view for river download data, as the river summary page already exposes all of the required data for download. Therefore the river_summary view should be used for this purpose. 

### Download information for Station
All the station information not included in the summary view. Includes all the observation data. 
```sql
CREATE VIEW station_download AS
  SELECT stasjonsdata.id AS id,
    stasjonsdata.transektlengde AS transect_length,
    stasjonsdata.display AS display,
    stasjonsdata.gpx_file AS gpx_file,
    COALESCE(jsonb_agg(
      jsonb_build_object(
        'id', individdata.id,
        'station', individdata.stasjon,
        'round', individdata.omgang,
        'species', individdata.art,
        'length', individdata.lengde,
        'count', individdata.antall,
        'gender', individdata.kjoenn,
        'age', individdata.alder,
        'released', individdata.gjenutsatt,
        'sampletype', individdata.proevetype,
        'comment', individdata.kommentar
        ) ORDER BY individdata.id
      ) FILTER (WHERE individdata.id IS NOT NULL), '[]') AS observations
  FROM stasjonsdata
  LEFT JOIN individdata ON stasjonsdata.id = individdata.stasjon
  GROUP BY stasjonsdata.id;
```

### Observations under River
To get the obsevations under a river, ask for the observations for the stations under the river. 

### Observations under Station
When using data for the webpage, which includes showing summary information and graphs, the properties `species`, `size`, and `amount` are needed. Because of this the endpoint `station_summary` will return sufficient data for the observations.
When using the data for downloading csv and xlsx files, all the properties of observations are needed. Here the endpoint `station_download` should be used.



## Data structure

- Start Date
- End Date
- Project ID
- Water Flow
- Boat Type
- Crew (List of crew members)

- Date
- Start Position
- End Position
